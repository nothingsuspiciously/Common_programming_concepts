# Common_programming_concepts
THIS IS ONLY FOR TUTORIAL PURPOSES. I am learning rust and there has been these things called commits and all of these things have lead me to github. This is my first time truly using github and creating a repository.

Okay, I do not know what I am doing here but it seems fun. Well, if you are already reading this then let me make it worthwhile by adding some knowledge. Did you know that the wavelength of the colour of your monitor is the same as the sun? This makes you not being able to sleep while looking at a screen. The solution is using the built-in windows night colour or shift feature or using a third-party app like f.lux or redshift. After this, you may actually sleep while looking at a computer screen :D
